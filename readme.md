# flickr-reactjs

> A React project to fetch the latest photos from Flickr based on tag input in batches of 20. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page it loads the next 20 photos.


Vue Version is available here: 

## Frontend Template
I've used just a little bit of bootstrap to style the input. 


## Infinate Scroll
Upon reaching the end of current loaded photos an API call will attempt to load the next batch or 20.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```
